# Inflation Effects and Future Work Insights
## Executive Summary
This project integrates datasets covering inflation trends in Egypt, job 
postings, and salary data to analyze the real impact of inflation on employment and income 
levels. Additionally, we assess job market dynamics and skill demand fluctuations to identify 
future-proof career paths. Using SQL databases, Python for data analysis, and Tableau for 
visualization, we aim to generate data-driven insights and recommendations.
